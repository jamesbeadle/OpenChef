    OpenChef is a community cookery platform that gives you a place to show off your cooking skills. 
    OpenChef gives you the tools to build recipes, courses and even your own cookery school. 
    Setup free and subscriptions based content along with competing to hold one of our signature dish titles. 
  </p>

  <p>
    OpenChef is built around the concept of unique recipes. No 2 recipes can contain the same ingredients and same preparation steps to qualify for a signature dish.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a chef on our platform you can manage your own recipes, create your own cookery school, with courses people can subscribe to and compete with chefs worldwide to see who can create the best signature dish.
  </p>
  <p>
    OpenChef operates as a DAO with users voting on whether something qualifies as a signature dish or is just a variation of another dish. 
    Rewards are calculated on the ranking of each chefs signature dish. Each user can star their favourite recipe for the day, never starring the same recipe twice in one week.</p>

  <p>
    OpenChef will provide discreet advertising space for restaurants to utilise, filterable by the categories of signature dishes people are looking at.
